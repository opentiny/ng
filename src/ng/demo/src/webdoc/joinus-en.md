- Before submitting an issue, please search for related content first to see if it has already been raised.

- When providing the Bug, please specify clearly the version number of @opentiny/ng and related environment used.

### Pull Request Specification

- Please fork a copy to your own project and create a branch for changes.

  ```bash
  git checkout -b my-branch master
  ```

- Follow [commit rules](https://github.com/opentiny/ng/blob/main/commit.template) when writing commit message.

- Prior to submitting a PR, please perform a rebase to ensure that the commit record is clean.
  ```bash
  git rebase master -i
  git push -f
  ```

- If you are fixing a `bug` or `issue`, please describe it clearly in the PR.


### Development

```bash

# fork && git clone
...
# my-branch
npm install
npm start

```

## Unit Testing

### Overall Testing
```bash
$ npm test ng-demo
```
or
```bash
$ npx ng test ng-demo
```

### Specific Component Testing
```bash
$ npm test ${component name for test}-demo
```
or
```bash
$ npx ng test ${component name for test}-demo
```

For example:
```bash
$ npm test text-demo
```

### Adding Test Cases

- Because each component in the library has a separate version, developers need to prepare a unit test environment for newly added components. (An automated script can also be used to generate the required files for the new component, such as: `npm build:test radio`)
- For existing components, simply create a `${your component name}.spec.json` file in the component `demo/` directory and write test scripts.
- If the `${your component name}.spec.json` file already exists in the component demo directory, simply modify the case in this file.

TinyNG uses the [Jasmine testing framework](https://jasmine.github.io/) to perform unit testing on the component library content.
The `npm test` command builds the application in **watch mode** and starts the [karma test runner](https://karma-runner.github.io/).
After the run is complete, the console outputs the test results in the following format:

```
âœ” Browser application bundle generation complete.
28 11 2022 08:40:17.804:WARN [karma]: No captured browser, open http://localhost:9876/
28 11 2022 08:40:17.824:INFO [karma-server]: Karma v6.3.20 server started at http://localhost:9876/

Chrome 107.0.0.0 (Windows 10): Executed 5 of 5 SUCCESS (0.562 secs / 0.815 secs)
TOTAL: 5 SUCCESS
```

It also opens the Chrome browser and displays the test output in the [Jasmine HTML Reporter](https://github.com/dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter). You can click on a specific test case to rerun it, or click on a description row to rerun the tests selected in that test suite.

Unit testing cases and related configurations are located in the `/src/test/` directory.
